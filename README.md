# golf_handicap_calculator
This project is to create a tool that will help calculate a golfer's handicap

More details to come, but off the top of my head:

* look into golf course/ scorecard apis for accessing course info
* some database and user auth so users can keep their scores?
* react 
* netlify?
* firebase?
